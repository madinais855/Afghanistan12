    <h1>KabuliPilau</h1>
    <p>Afghan cuisine offers a rich variety of dishes,
         with Kabuli Pulao (a rice dish with meat, carrots, and raisins)
          being the most famous and often considered the national dish. 
          Other popular dishes include Bolani (a stuffed flatbread), Mantu (dumplings), 
          and Borani Banjan (an eggplant dish with yogurt). </p>

    <h1>MANTU</h1>
    <p>
        Mmmm…  Dumplings!  If you’re familiar with Tibetan momos, Beijing Baos,
         Japanese Gyozas or Korean Mandoo, then Mantu will be a great taste to indulge in for the beginner. 
          I was personally thrilled to learn about this dish as the name is very similar
           to the word used for dumplings in Korean.  Traditionally, Mantu is stuffed with 
           beef or lamb then steamed.  Some would say that this is the most popular “street food” of Afghanistan
            but make no mistake, this is a dish that is not just found on a street corner, 
            it is a popular dish that can be eaten in many different ways. 
             The most common is to have Mantu served with “chaka” which is drained yoghurt, minced garlic, lemon, salt.
               Toppings vary but unlike most dumplings found in Asia, Afghans seem to prefer theirs with toppings
                rather than having it with a side dip.  All good!</p>

    <h1>Kabob (aka: Kabab, Kebab, Kebob)</h1>
    <p>Kabob (aka: Kabab, Kebab, Kebob)
        From Persian and/or Turkish roots, this meat on a stick is a favourite of mine,
         but who can argue with marinated meat (usually lamb) skewered and roasted over charcoal.
           Most North Americans and Europeans would be familiar with Shish Kabob or Doner Kabob but the variations 
           of this dish are too many to mention but you are sure to enjoy this staple. 
            Traditionally, Kabobs in Afghanistan is not eaten with rice, rather, with bread 
            but I don’t think you’ll find any issues if you have your lamb, chicken or
             beef kabob on a bed of basmati rice or pulao.</p>
