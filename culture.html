            <p>Afghan culture is a blend of diverse ethnic influences,
                 strongly rooted in Islamic traditions and characterized by
                  strong family ties and hospitality.
                   The country's location at the crossroads of multiple
                    cultural regions has resulted in a rich tapestry
                     of traditions, customs, and regional variations.<br><br>
                     <strong>Attan (Pashto: اتڼ)</strong> ,the national dance of Afghanistan, 
                     is a traditional dance originating from the tribal Pashtun regions. 
     The dance is performed during weddings or other celebrations (engagements, weddings and informal gatherings). </p>

        <p>Clothing in Afghanistan consists of the traditional style of clothing worn in Afghanistan.
             The various cultural exchanges in the nation's history have influenced the styles and flavors
              of contemporary Afghan designs.[1] The styles can be subdivided into the various ethnicities 
              with unique elements for each. Traditional dresses for both men and women tend 
              to cover the whole body, with trousers gathered at the waist, a loose shirt or dress, and some form
               of head covering</p>

    <div class="men">
        <h1>Men's clothing</h1>
               <p>The perahan tunban is the standard traditional outfit for men, 
                consisting of a tunic shirt, pants, and optional head covering.
                 It originates from the ancient nomadic eastern Iranians, ancestors to both Tajiks and Pashtuns, 
                 and remains traditional among people in Afghanistan. Some of the more famous varieties
                  are the Kandahari Doozi and Herati Doozi styles. [4] Turbans (lungis)[5] are worn all
                   over the country, but the fabric, color, and style vary from region by region.
                    For example, an Uzbek hat from the north of the country is distinct from a Pashtun 
                    hat worn in the south.</p>
