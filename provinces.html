            <h2>Balhk</h2>
            <p>Mazar-e-Sharif has been an important city in the quest 
                for power between different forces throughout Afghanistan's history. 
                There are several reasons why control over this city is important for whosoever 
                seeks to rule Afghanistan. The Soviets, the Taliban and NATO realised it in the past, 
                and the resurgent Taliban of 2021 too knows it very well.</p>
